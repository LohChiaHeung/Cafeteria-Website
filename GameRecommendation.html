                  <p class="description3">Quick Matches or Rank Matches consist of five players. With one player as a Hunter, and the remaining four as Survivors.
                  Each survivor is roughly classified into 4 different categories: Decode types, Assist types, Contain types, and Rescue types. The Hunter's objective is to find and eliminate all of the Survivors before they can escape. 
                  To do this, the Hunter must pursue each Survivor individually, then eliminate them by placing them down on a Rocket Chair. Meanwhile, the Survivor's objective is to try to escape via two Exit Gates by deciphering five Cipher 
                  Machines, or the Dungeon if there's one Survivor left.
