            <p class="abc">
            <img class="mypictures" src="https://cdn3.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/27/02/chemistry-and-physics-science-banners-vector-11952702.jpg" alt="physics and chemistry picture">
            My favourite subject in secondary school actually is <em>Chemistry and Physics.</em> Since i were still an child, I love to study about sains.
            <br>But, After SPM,I think that I can't handle the sains course well especially for Chemistry in university. In the case study , Chemistry is ranked at 3th place in the difficult course list.
            And also, I actually didn't like to study at home for whole day because  need to memorize all the topics.
            <br>Then, I decided to change my subject in univeristy. I selected Diploma in Information Technology.
            My brother who studied Information Technology also encouraged me to study in this field because this field is more valuable in future too. There are more jobs opportunities in future too because
            a lot of companies need a large number of programmers. 
            <br>This subject is also not easy for me because I am actually a newbie in this field.I didn't have any computer knowledges like coding or hardware and software knowledge. 
            This subject also require a lot of time to study, debug, practice. Practice makes perfect,I will try my best to study well in order to achieve success in future.

            Next is about my characteristics. I am a real shy people in the reality. I didn't like to talk much and are afraid of strange environment. I need some times to adapt to it no matter people or environment.
            So, I think that this subject is suitable for me. Just do and do. No need to talk much~XDDü§£<br>
            I actually likes to play computer games too such as Dota 2, Identity V, Paladins and so on.
            <br>
            Before that, I have a dream that's becoming E-sports professional player. But,ya I think that I didn't have this
            talentü§£. Family members also said that it is not a stable jobs. Therefore, only during my freetime, I will play computer games with my friend. I love the feeling that when we defeat enemy with our teamwork.
